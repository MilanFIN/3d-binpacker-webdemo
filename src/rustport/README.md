# 3D Binpacker (Rust)

A high-performance 3D bin-packing library ported to Rust, supporting both native and WebAssembly targets optional GPU acceleration.

Contains two stages: The packing algorithm and an genetic algorithm based optimizer that iterates over packing solutions to search for denser results.

## Related Projects
* **Web Demo**: An interactive demo for this project's usage [https://github.com/MilanFIN/3d-binpacker-webdemo](https://github.com/MilanFIN/3d-binpacker-webdemo).
* **Reference Implementation**: The reference Java implementation of this optimizer is available at [https://github.com/MilanFIN/gpu-binpacker](https://github.com/MilanFIN/gpu-binpacker).

## Compute Modes

### Native Support
* **CPU Computing**: Uses multithreading to evaluate multiple packing attempts in parallel.
* **GPU Computing**: Uses **OpenCL** to offload packing attempt calculations to the GPU. Requires the `opencl` feature flag (see [Features](#features)).

### Web Support
* **CPU Computing**: Uses **WebAssembly (Wasm)**.
* **GPU Computing**: Uses **WebGPU** to run the packing attempts on the GPU, the optimizer is identical to the CPU version

## Features

| Feature | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `parallel` | ❌ | Enables multithreaded CPU solver via `rayon`. |
| `opencl` | ❌ | Enables the native OpenCL GPU solver. Requires `libOpenCL` to be installed on the system (e.g. `ocl-icd-opencl-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu). |

> **Note:** OpenCL is **opt-in** and disabled by default. The standard `cargo build` / `cargo test` workflow does **not** require any GPU drivers or OpenCL runtime to be present.

## Building

### Regular Target (Native)
To build the library for your local machine:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

To enable rayon
```bash
cargo build --release --features parallel
```

To enable OpenCL GPU support (requires `libOpenCL` installed):
```bash
cargo build --release --features opencl
```

### WebAssembly
To build for web browsers or JS bundlers:
```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```
*(Alternatively: `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`)*

This generates a `pkg/` directory containing the Wasm binary and JS glue code.

## Usage & Data Formats

The JavaScript interface is defined in `src/wasm_api.rs`. It provides a stateful `WasmOptimizer` for genetic-algorithm based bin packing and a one-shot `pack` function.

### Input Format (CSV)
When importing box data (as often used in the demo or testing), each line should represent a box in the following format:
`width, height, depth, [weight]`

*The weight parameter is optional. Lines starting with `#` are ignored.*

### Output Format (CSV)
Exported solutions follow this format:
`Bin, Box, x, y, z, w, h, d`

*Representing each packed box's bin assignment, ID, position (x, y, z), and dimensions (w, h, d).*

## Testing

### Unit Tests (Native)

Runs all `#[test]` functions across the library's modules (data models, solvers, optimizer):

```bash
cargo test
```

To also see output from passing tests:

```bash
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

### Integration Tests (WebAssembly)

The WASM integration tests live in `tests/wasm_api_tests.rs` and exercise the full
JSON → Rust → WASM → Rust → JSON pipeline for every public entry-point
(`pack`, `WasmOptimizer`, `WasmGeneticPool`, `evaluate_single_placement`).
They require `wasm-pack` and a headless browser driver.

**Firefox:**
```bash
wasm-pack test --headless --firefox -- --test wasm_api_tests
```

**Chrome:**
```bash
wasm-pack test --headless --chrome -- --test wasm_api_tests
```

> **Note:** Chrome may require `--no-sandbox` in some CI or containerised environments.
> If the Chrome driver crashes, prefer the Firefox variant.
